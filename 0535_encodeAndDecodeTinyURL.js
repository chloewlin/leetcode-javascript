// Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design TinyURL.
// https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/124658/Design-a-URL-Shortener-(-TinyURL-)-System/

// TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl 
// and it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.

// Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode 
// algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be 
// decoded to the original URL.
var encode = function(longUrl) {
    
};

var decode = function(shortUrl) {
    
};
